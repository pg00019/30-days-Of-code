Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:

Inherits from Book

string 
string 
int 
Implements the Book class' abstract display() method so it prints these  lines:

, a space, and then the current instance's .
, a space, and then the current instance's .
Note: Because these classes are being written in the same file, you must not use an access modifier (e.g.: ) when declaring MyBook or your code will not execute.
